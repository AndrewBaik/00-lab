##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)

---I placed all the stylings that are applied to entire page to base.css,
Placed styling applied to a whole element to layout.css,
and I applied styling to specific elements to modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(Put your answer here)
No, I didn't want to complicate the pre-existing namings by renaming it as it works fine as it is.
